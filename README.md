# John Sullivan's Portfolio

This repo contains all of the code that makes up my portfolio available at [johnsullivan.name](http://johnsullivan.name).

I hope to eventually expand my portfolio site to also include a blog, and leverage my project [Phial](https://github.com/brownhead/phial), but for now the site is a very simple static website. The code along with other resources I've added to the repo are in the `master-source` branch. The `deploy.sh` script transfers the website to the `master` branch which GitHub Pages then serves.
