# John Sullivan's Portfolio

## Development

The code for the site itself is located in the `site/` directory. You can use the script `serve.sh` in the `utils/` directory to serve the website locally on port 8080 (point your browser at http://localhost:8080).

When ready to launch the code, make sure that all changes to `master-source` are committed. Then run `deploy.sh`. After it exits you will be in the `master` branch. You will have to add all changes (`git add -A` is a good way to do that quickly) then you will have to make a commit, the message does not matter and I usually default to something along the lines of `Deploying.`.
