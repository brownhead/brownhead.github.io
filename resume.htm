        <h1>Technologies</h1>
        <p>
            Following is a list of technologies I have worked professionally with. Each list is sorted alphabetically.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am confident that I can begin working at a professional level with any of these technologies with an hour or less or preparation. Go ahead an ask my about any of these.
        </p>
        <h2>Programming Languages</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>C++</li>
            <li>C#</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
            <li>Python</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Frameworks</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Boost <em>(certain libraries within)</em></li>
            <li>Flask</li>
            <li>jQuery</li>
            <li>WPF</li>
            <li>XNA</li>

            <li>MongoDB</li>
            <li>nginx</li>
            <li>uWSGI</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Work Experience</h1>
        <p>
            I am a current undergraduate in college, so my work experience is not long and rich. However, I began working as a freelance developer in high school and have been active since then, so I am certainly not without work experience.
        </p>
        <h2>Freelance Development</h2>
        <p>
            Starting my Freshman year of high school I worked as a freelance software engineer. I found jobs through RentACoder.com (which no longer exists) and CraigsList.
        </p>
        <p>
            I did a number of contracts during those years, longer ones taking more than a year (had two of those I got off craigslist) and shorter ones that took significantly longer (had several of those from RentACoder).
        </p>
        <p>
            There are not a lot of records of my work during that time and I've even lost most of the code I created in those years. But some of it is still around that I'm happy to show anyone who is interested (though it will have to be in person as I do not have rights to distribute the code I made under contract).
        </p>
        <h2>JetHead</h2>
        <p>
            I interned at JetHead Development Inc. last summer (the summer of 2012) and plan to do so again this summer. It was a traditional paid internship, and it was a lot of fun. My main achievement while there was a complete rewrite of the code that handled the display of closed captions on one of their new set top boxes. Having the freedom to completely write a large portion of important code was a lot of fun.
        </p>
        <h2>Galah</h2>
        <p>
            I started the company Galah Group LLC with a friend of mine, Chris Manghane, to develop and promote our product Galah which you can read more about in the list of projects section of the portfolio.
        </p>
        <p>
            Working on Galah has been an excuse to learn a great deal of things I would never have learned otherwise, and working closely with the system administrators and faculty at UCR who are using our product has been an amazing learning experience. I think I've learned more developing this project than any other project I've ever been able to work on.
        </p>
        <h2>Supplemental Instructor</h2>
        <p>
            I am a Supplemental Instructor at UCR and have been since my Freshman year in college. My job is to help learning Computer Science students better their craft. Despite the job being fairly time consuming I enjoy it greatly and I hope wherever I end up after college involves me teaching at least part time.
