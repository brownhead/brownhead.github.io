                I began this project in 2011 with the intent of creating a scalable system that could grade CS students' assignment and providing nearly-instant feedback. In December 2012, the University of California, Riverside began using it in one of their classes. Now it is being used extensively in several courses including UCR's new online course offerings. The school hosts it at <a href="https://galah.cs.ucr.edu">galah.cs.ucr.edu</a>, but you won't be able to play with it without being enrolled in a class unfortunately.
            </p>
            <p>
                Galah is a distributed system that is (theoretically) able to scale up to any number of users. It tests each student's code by placing their code in a clean virtual machine with the instructor's test harness. It is fairly stable and was able to perform well with no intervention whatsoever during my 3-month long internship over the summer of 2013.
            </p>
            <p>
                Working on Galah has been more fun than I ever expected, and I hope that eventually I'll be able to greatly improve the learning experience for CS students across the world.

                I created this experiment after seeing <a href="http://carlosbergen.com">Carlos Bergen's simple website</a>. I didn't want to simply clone his website though, so I decided to make an interesting effect based off of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a> which has always fascinated me. Many hours, and a few cups of coffee later, I had my own little website that I could show off.

                A simple tool for turning a multi-file, multi-dependency Python script into a single executable file.
            </p>
            <p>
                I often make little Python utilities that I'd like to share. Unfortunately, installing a Python program that's more than a few files can be intimidating to non-Python developers. Superzippy solves this problem by providing an easy way to transform my multi-file Python utilities into a single executable file.
            </p>
            <p>
                The motivation for this utility came from <a href="#galah">Galah</a> because we needed to distribute <a href="https://github.com/galah-group/galah-apiclient">a command line Python application</a> to teachers and TA's.

                A flash game that puts a big twist on the classic game of Connect 4.
            </p>
            <a href="/res/img/projectshots/agc4.png">
                <img class="project-shot" src="/res/img/projectshots/agc4.png" />
            </a>
            <p>
                The game itself came before the program, and was devised in a particularly dull math class Sophemore year of high school. My friend and I would play Connect 4 on graph paper but after many weeks of playing it we got a little bored so I came up with a twist on the classic game. I made the board into a round-ish shape and changed the rules so that you could go anywhere as long as that would make sense given that down was any of 4 different ways. Check out the <a href="http://youtu.be/4BMXRENMO-c">video demo</a> (link is also below) for a walk through of the rules and a clip of my friend beating me in my own game.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have left my young blunderings untouched, therefore the game has a few noticeable issues (notably an unmutable, loud background audio track). It was my first ever (and one of my only) Flash games however, so the love and nostalgia I feel for it is enormous. Therefore I hope you have a moment to learn the rules with a friend and challenge each-other's wits.

                A C++ implementation of a very interesting data structure that allows efficient removal of the largest and the smallest item from the same heap.
            </p>
            <p>
                Freshman year of college I was working on an interesting program that would allow me to automatically discover my ideal course schedule. Along the way, I realized I needed a way to efficiently get both the maximum and minimum element from a heap. After looking around a little bit, I saw a description of a data structure called a Min-Max Heap that supposedly offered good performance. I crafted my own implementation of this heap, but I found out afterwards that another data structure (Interval Heaps) have better real-world performance. Regardless, I'm still very proud of my creation.
            </p>
            <p>
                I created a <a href="http://forestofcode.blogspot.com/2010/12/c-min-max-heap-implementation.html">blog post</a> about it at the time that explains the data structure in detail.

                A C program using <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/">SDL</a> that attempts to emulate the effect of the <a href="http://www.chromeexperiments.com/detail/liquid-particles/">Liquid Particles Chrome Experiment</a>.

            <p>
                I remember seeing the Chrome Experiment back in high school as I was sitting in my communication class and wanting so badly to figure out how they made the effect so incredible. Only after creating my own version of it was I able to figure it out. The simulation reminds me of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a> in that a simple concept and set of rules gives birth to a simulation that has a lot of subtle complexity.

                Check out the video demo below to see me play around with it and talk a little about its motivation and origins. Then if you have some extra time, you can download, compile, and run the source code from GitHub. It should compile onto most platforms (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_DirectMedia_Layer#Ports">the SDL library supports quite a few</a>).

            <p>
                This was one of my first large applications and it went through at least three different major versions (the first two have been lost unfortunately) as I made my way through middle school. It began when a user came onto a forum I visited frequently at the time asking for a way to keep his parents from knowing that he was playing <a href="http://www.runescape.com">runescape</a>, without having to close the window all the time. I was happy to oblige him and over the years I improved what I had made until I released the third version of the program right before I entered High School.
