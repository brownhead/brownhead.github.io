                An automated grading system geared towards processing computer programming assignments.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started this project Freshman year of college in 2010 with the intent of creating a scalable system that was capable of grading students' assignment and providing nearly-instant feedback. At the beginning of 2013, the University of California, Riverside began using it in one of their classes. Now it is being used extensively in several courses including UCR's new online course offerings. Chris Manghane joined me in my developement around that time and together we've been improving it to the best of our abilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Galah is a distributed system that is (theoretically) able to scale up to any number of users. It tests each student's code by placing their code in a clean virtual machine with the instructor's test harness. It is fairly stable and was able to perform well with no intervention whatsoever during my 3-month long internship over the summer of 2013.
            </p>
            <p>
                Working on Galah has been more fun than I ever expected, and though I have doubts about whether Galah will stand above its emerging competitors, I hope to continue development on it long into the future.

                A small experiment with <a href="http://processingjs.org/">Processing.js</a>.

            <p>
                I created this experiment after seeing <a href="http://carlosbergen.com">Carlos Bergen's simple website</a>. I didn't want to simply clone his website though, so I decided to make an interesting effect based off of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a> which has always fascinated me. Many hours, and a few cups of coffee later, I had my own little website that I could show off.
