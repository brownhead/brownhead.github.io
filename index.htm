        <h1>About this Site</h1>
        <p>
            This is an unfinished, fairly raw, but still useful portfolio demoing my work. My long-form resume is also housed here.
        </p>
        <p>
            My name is John Sullivan and I am a Junior in college attending the University of California, Riverside as a Computer Scientist. I began my road towards becoming a software engineer when I was in elementary school (ask me about this, it's an amusing story), began formal software development work in high school (more information on this in the work experience section of my resume), and am now trying to figure out where I will end up after my formal education ends.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm always interesting in talking with other software engineers so please feel free to send me an <a href="mailto:jsull003@ucr.edu">email</a> regarding anything (though please no solicitation).
