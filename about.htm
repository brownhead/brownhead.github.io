        <h2>Technologies I Like</h2>
        <p>
            I've played with many different technologies and languages, but only some of them really stuck to me as really great. Here are some technologies and areas that I have had a strong history with, and would love to work with professionally in the future.

        <h2>Backstory</h2>
        <p>
            I've loved programming for a very long time (relative to my life span at least). The first time I started programming was in 3<sup>rd</sup> grade on <a href="http://neopets.com">neopets.com</a>. The user profiles there could be customized with basic HTML and CSS (think <a href="http://myspace.com">Myspace</a> for super young kids), and I would copy and paste little snippets online to get my profile to look one way or the other.
        </p>
        <p>
            Eventually I started using the several web hosts that were around at the time like <a href="http://homestead.com/">homestead.com</a> and of course <a href="http://geocities.com">GeoCities</a> and started building full websites. I have sharp memories of going over to my friend's house and making silly websites on homestead in some room that looked oddly like a storage room. Fast forward a couple years and in 6<sup>th</sup> through 8<sup>th</sup> grades I was spending every day after school making silly little programs in the old Windows Shell Language (<code>cmd.exe</code> style) and Visual Basic 6 like one of the programs featured in the projects page, <a href="/projects.htm#cloak">Cloak</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            During this time I was spending a lot of time on a few online forums, most notably the now defunct cruels.net. I absolutely owe my love of programming to those communities where I was able to show off my work and learn from other very young programmers like myself. Even more so though, I could not have done what I was doing without the support of my mother, who was always excited to see my latest creations, no matter how silly they were. She was also very patient with me when she found me programming at 3 AM in my room several times on school days, and didn't take my computer away.
        </p>
        <p>
            Starting sometime in High School I began doing freelance work on sites like rentacoder.com (now <a href="http://freelancer.com">freelancer.com</a>) and <a href="http://craigslist.com">craigslist</a>. I stopped doing freelance work when I entered college due to other responsibilities I took on, but the work I did for various people and companies gave me a taste of software engineering on a professional level, and made me certain that I want to do it for the rest of my life.
