        <p>
            I've played with many different technologies and languages, but only some of them really struck me as great. Here are some technologies and areas that I have had a strong history with, and would love to work with professionally in the future.

        <p>
            I've loved programming for a very long time (relative to my life span at least). The first time I started programming was in 3<sup>rd</sup> grade on <a href="http://neopets.com">neopets</a>. The user profiles there could be customized with basic HTML and CSS (think <a href="http://myspace.com">Myspace</a> for super young kids), and I would copy and paste little snippets I found online to get my profile to look one way or the other.
        </p>
        <p>
            Eventually I started making more complex websites using the several web hosts that were around at the time like <a href="http://homestead.com/">homestead</a> and <a href="http://geocities.com">GeoCities</a>. I have sharp memories of going over to my friend's house and making silly pages on homestead in some room that looked oddly like a storage room. Fast forward a couple years and in 6<sup>th</sup> through 8<sup>th</sup> grades I was spending every day after school making little programs in the old Windows Shell Language (<code>cmd.exe</code> style) and Visual Basic 6 (<a href="/projects.htm#cloak">one of my Visual Basic 6 applications is featured in the projects page</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
            During this period I was spending a lot of time on a few online forums, most notably the now defunct cruels.net. There I was able to show off my work and learn from other very young programmers like myself. Whenever anyone asks me where I learned how to program, I tell them about cruels.net because of the massive impact it made on my life. I should also mention my mother who was always excited to see my latest creations, no matter how silly they were. She was also very patient with me when she found me, several times, programming at 3 AM in my room on school days. I imagine if she had just taken my computer away I would have been in a much different situation today.
        </p>
        <p>
            In high school, after branching out into some other technologies including C, C++, and C#, I began doing freelance work on sites like <a href="http://craigslist.com">craigslist</a> and rentacoder (now <a href="http://freelancer.com">freelancer</a>). I worked as a freelancer throughout high school, and though I did not make a lot of money, the work I did taught me a lot about what it meant to be a professional software engineer, and helped me realize I definitely want a career as one.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now I'm a 4<sup>th</sup>-year Junior attending the University of California, Riverside, and I still stay up late many nights working on silly projects. I have more responsibilities than I used to as a child, so I can't drop everything and work on some ridiculous idea for several weeks like I used to, but I still find time to make cool little programs. Check out my <a href="https://github.com/brownhead">GitHub account</a> (and my <a href="https://github.com/brownhead2">additional staging account</a>) for the most recent things I've been working on.
